          | OPEN Forum was started by American Express to help small-business owners and entrepreneurs exchange insights and advice so they could make smart and well-informed decisions. I first joined the OPEN Forum team right during my time at Kettle - when they shipped the MVP to a seeded beta community in Fall 2012. Since then, I have watched and helped it grow into one of the largest entrepreneurial communities on the web with thousands of users exchanging advice everyday.

          | This case-study demonstrates my process for re-designing the existing detail pages where the exchange of advice between our users took place.
